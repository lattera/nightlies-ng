============

A modular build system with dependency tracking support for my FreeBSD dev server. This project is very much a
work-in-progress. The goal is to eventually make this into a threaded build system so that independent build jobs
can build in parallel.

This code is targeted for Python 2.7. I haven't even tried Python 3.
